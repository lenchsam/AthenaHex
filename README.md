# Athena Hex

Hi! This project shows **Procedural Generation** in **C#** using **Unity**. This readme file will explain all of the features currently implemented, as well as the future for the project as it is still in active development.

## About

Athena Hex utilises a variety of different procedural generation techniques to achieve a hexagon grid-based map. These include poisson disc sampling, perlin noise, and more. It was originally inspired by a mobile game called *The Battle of Polytopia*; I wanted to replicate this in my own way. It's currently just a programming adventure for me, but I aim to add some unique and well designed mechanics in the future.
## Useful Links

 - [Procedural Generation Class](https://github.com/lenchsam/AthenaHex/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/HexGrid/ProceduralGeneration.cs)
 - [Grid Functions Class](https://github.com/lenchsam/AthenaHex/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/HexGrid/)

## Features

 - Poisson Disc Sampling used to get the spawn locations of players
 - Voronoi noise used for biomes
 - Perlin Noise to create height layers
 - Fog of War
 - Turn-based combat

## Getting Started
### Requirements

 - Unity version 6000.0.23f1
 - Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE)

### Setup
 1. Clone the repository. 
 2. Open the project using Unity Hub.
 3. Navigate to the `Assets -> Scenes` folder and open the **MainMenu** scene.
 4. Experiment and explore the project!

### Changing Variables
The variables that you'll probably want to have fun with are located in the ----GridManager---- game object. This manages all of the [procedural generation](https://github.com/lenchsam/AthenaHex/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/HexGrid/ProceduralGeneration.cs) and the [grid functions](https://github.com/lenchsam/AthenaHex/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/HexGrid/).

### Common Issues
 - make sure to also lower poisson-disc radius when making map size smaller in editor. If this isn't done, it can freeze the editor.

## Future Features

 - Resource farming
 - Updated camera system
 - Districts
 - System to buy/make units, districts and potentially more
 - UI
 - SFX
 - Code optimisations
 - Reworked battle system to have more interactive battles when a unit attacks another unit
